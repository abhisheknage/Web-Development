# Welcome to my Github page

My name is Abhishek and I'm an ex-materials engineer, and currently learning Medicine in Australia. One of my passions is coding, and I have coded for the most part of my life in various languages, such as C++, Java, Python, and am recently learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I'm currently part of a 30 weeks Virtual Bootcamp - #100DevsBootcamp


# What am I learning next?
I plan to learn Node.js, Postgres, and React.js
